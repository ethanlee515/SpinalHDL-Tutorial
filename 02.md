# valid

Consider we have 3 modules in a hardware
- a Client that provides some data
- an Accumulator that computes the sum of the data
- a Server that prints the sum

- the Client only provides data occasionally, not in every clock cycle.
- but hardware is active in every clock cycle, so we need a `valid` signal to indicate if Client output something

- `Flow` in spinalhdl adds a `valid` signal to a data
```scala
case class MyFlow[T <: Data](dataType: T) extends Bundle {
    val payload = cloneOf(T)
    val valid = Bool()
}
```

# ready

Consider we have 3 modules in a hardware
- a Client that provides some data
- an Accumulator that computes the sum of the data
- a Server that prints the sum

- the Accumulator requires multiple clock cycle to compute the sum
- during the computation, the Accumulator cannot process new input
- so we need a `ready` signal to tell the Client if the Accumulator is available
- note that `ready` goes from Accumulator to Client, which is different from `payload` and `valid`

- `Stream` in spinalhdl adds a `valid` and `ready` signal to a data
```scala
case class MyStream[T <: Data](dataType: T) extends Bundle with IMasterSlave{
    val payload = cloneOf(T)
    val valid = Bool()
    val ready = Bool()

    def asMaster() = {
        out(payload)
        out(valid)
        in(ready)
    }
}

val o = master port MyStream(SInt(10 bits))
```
- in hardware design, master interface outputs data/instructions; slave interface receives data/instructions
- by implementing the `asMaster` method in the `IMasterSlave` interface of SpinalHDL, we can use `master` and `slave` to set the direction of all signals in a bundle.
  - `master port x` call `x.asMaster()`
  - `slave port x` invert the direction of all signals after call `x.asMaster()`

# fifo

fifo queue is a common way to decouple the master and the slave to obtain the best throughput

## exercise 3
- implement a fifo with `Stream` interface
- read the implementation of `StreamFifo` of SpinalHDL
```scala
case class SimpleFifo(depth: Int) extends Component {
  val dataType = HardType(SInt(10 bits))
  val push = slave port Stream(dataType())
  val pop = master port Stream(dataType())

  // large fanout is bad
  // implement a fifo
  // after implementation, see StreamFifo(dataType, depth = 10)
}
```
- read `Stream.s2mPipe` to see how to cut the large fanout of the ready signal, if you are using chain of registers to implement fifo.

# arbiter

- When we have multiple Client but a single Accumulator, the Accumulator needs to select an input to receive. This is done by using an arbiter.
- Gates to implement an arbiter
  - `OHMasking.firstV2(bs: Bits)`: given an input of `Bits`, output a `Bits` of the same length, where only the first `true` is left with other bits set to `false`
    - Example: input 00101011 -> output 00100000
  - `OHMux.or(sel: Bits, data: Vec[T])`: if the i-th bit of sel is true, the output will be data(i)
- Other arbiters: see `OHMasking`

# RAM
- Random access memory is a common building block in computer. It is possible to implement RAM using registers and multiplexers, but it takes a lot of resource to do so. FPGAs provide Block RAMs (BRAM) that can be used as a RAM directly.
- In SpinalHDL, we can create a RAM using `Mem`
```scala
val mem = Mem.fill(1024)(SInt(32 bits))
```
which is a RAM with 1024 SInt(32 bits)
- To read/write from a RAM, we create a `readWriteSyncPort`
```scala
val memPort = mem.readWriteSyncPort()
```
- a "SyncPort" will read/write the data in the next clock cycle
  - `memPort.address`: the address used to read/write
  - `memPort.wdata`: data written to `address` when `memPort.write` is True
  - `memPort.rdata`: data read from `address` when `memPort.write` is False
- a BRAM can have at most 2 `readWriteSyncPort`s

# exercise 4: 
- read the SimplePulseGenerator in Ex4, try to implement using the [state machine library](https://spinalhdl.github.io/SpinalDoc-RTD/master/SpinalHDL/Libraries/fsm.html) instead of the `State` enum
- in Ex4_2, implement a pulse generator that send a pulse when cmd.start === time. 
- use a fifo to store pending pulses
