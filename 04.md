# Area

In SpinalHDL, `Area` is a namespace in a `Component`, which acts like a collection of data and sub `Components`.
```scala
case class Multiplier() extends Component {
    val x = in SInt(16 bits)
    val y = in SInt(16 bits)
    val z = out SInt(16 bits)
    z := x * y
} 

case class AreaDemo() extends Component {
    val i = in SInt(16 bits)
    val o = out SInt(16 bits)

    val multByFive = new Area {
        val multiplier = Multiplier()
        multiplier.x := i
        multiplier.y := S(5, 16 bits)
        val res = Reg(SInt(16 bits))
        res := multiplier.z.resized
    }

    o := multByFive.res
}
```

## Area vs Bundle

- `Bundle` defines a new type of data, which consists of multiple data
- `Area` is a collection of hardware, which contains data and sub `Components`.
- `Area` can own `Component`s, while `Bundle` can't
- `Bundle` can be assigned by another `Bundle`, `Area` can't
- We can create `Reg(SomeBundle)`, but not `Reg(SomeArea)`


# plugin

`FiberPlugin` is just an extension of `Area`, with support of interleaving the building process of different `Area`s, so that they can easily exchange parameters while building.
```scala
class FiberPlugin extends Area with Hostable { // FiberPlugin is extension of Area
```

## Common design pattern in our hardware design

- Everything is implemented in some plugin
- The toplevel is just a `Component` that receive some plugins as parameters, and create a `host` for all the plugin.
```scala
  case class Top(plugins: Seq[FiberPlugin]) extends Component {
    val host = new PluginHost()
    host.asHostOf(plugins)
  }
```
- All the hardware logic of a plugin should be written in some `during setup new Area` in some `FiberPlugin`
- A plugin is usually built in two phases
  - In the setup phase, setup some necessary information that other plugins may want to access
  - In the build phase, write the hardware logic
- Use `awaitBuild` to wait for the build phase
```scala
  case class InPlugin() extends FiberPlugin {
    val logic = during setup new Area {
      val width = 16
      awaitBuild()
      val i = in(UInt(16 bits))
    }
  }
```

- A plugin can access other plugins in the same host using `host[OtherPlugin]`
```scala
  case class OutPlugin() extends FiberPlugin {
    val logic = during setup new Area {
      awaitBuild()
      val inPlugin = host[InPlugin] // access the InPlugin of the host
      val width = inPlugin.logic.width
      val o = out(UInt(width bits))

      o := inPlugin.logic.i
    }
  }
```

- We use `Retainer`s, which are just locks in multi-threading, to control the generating of the logic of each plugin, so that some plugin can control the behaviour of other plugins.
